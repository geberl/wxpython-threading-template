wxPython Threading Template
==========================

This is a basic template for creating Python applications that use [wxPython](http://wxpython.org).

The Python code of the graphical user interface in ``gui.py`` is generated by [wxFormBuilder](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/) (3.5.0 beta). The editable project file is ``gui.fbp``. Modify this file with WxFormbuilder and select *File*, *Generate code* afterwards.

A clean exit is ensured regardless (no thread killing).

Use case: The actual function can be implemented to analyze log files, take screenshots, check for files, check the system load or disk space, ...
